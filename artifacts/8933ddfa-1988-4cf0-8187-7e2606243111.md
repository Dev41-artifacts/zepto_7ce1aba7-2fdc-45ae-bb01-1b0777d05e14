# ER Diagram Artifact

To design an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram for the Zepto platform focused on food ordering and delivery, we need to consider various entities and their relationships. Below is a detailed description of the entities and relationships:

### Entities:

1. **User**
   - Attributes: User_ID (PK), Name, Email, Phone_Number, Address, User_Type (e.g., Busy Professional, Family, College Student)

2. **Order**
   - Attributes: Order_ID (PK), User_ID (FK), Order_Date, Delivery_Address, Total_Amount, Order_Status (e.g., Pending, In-Progress, Delivered)

3. **Menu Item**
   - Attributes: Item_ID (PK), Item_Name, Category (e.g., Snack, Beverage), Price, Availability_Status

4. **Order_Item**
   - Attributes: Order_Item_ID (PK), Order_ID (FK), Item_ID (FK), Quantity

5. **Delivery**
   - Attributes: Delivery_ID (PK), Order_ID (FK), Delivery_Person_ID (FK), Delivery_Time, Delivery_Status (e.g., On-Time, Delayed)

6. **Delivery Person**
   - Attributes: Delivery_Person_ID (PK), Name, Phone_Number, Vehicle_Info, Availability_Status

7. **Payment**
   - Attributes: Payment_ID (PK), Order_ID (FK), Payment_Method (e.g., Credit Card, PayPal), Payment_Status (e.g., Completed, Pending)

8. **Feedback**
   - Attributes: Feedback_ID (PK), Order_ID (FK), User_ID (FK), Rating (1-5), Comments

### Relationships:

- **User to Order**: One-to-Many (One user can place many orders)
- **Order to Order_Item**: One-to-Many (One order can contain multiple menu items)
- **Menu Item to Order_Item**: One-to-Many (One menu item can appear in multiple orders)
- **Order to Delivery**: One-to-One (One order has one delivery associated with it)
- **Order to Payment**: One-to-One (One order has one payment associated with it)
- **Delivery to Delivery Person**: Many-to-One (Multiple deliveries can be handled by one delivery person)
- **Order to Feedback**: One-to-Many (One order can receive multiple feedback entries)
- **User to Feedback**: One-to-Many (One user can provide multiple feedback entries)

### ER Diagram Representation:

```plaintext
[User] ----------< [Order] >---------- [Feedback]
  |                  |
  |                  |
  |                  |
  |                  |
  +-------------< [Order_Item] >--------------+
  |                   |                        |
  |                   |                        |
  |                   |                        |
  |                   |                        |
[Menu Item]         [Delivery]               [Payment]
                      |
                      |
                   [Delivery Person]
```

### Explanation:

1. **User** can be a busy professional, family, or college student, which influences their preferences for food ordering.
2. **Orders** are tied to the user, with each order consisting of multiple **Order_Items** referring to the **Menu Items**.
3. Each **Order** is associated with exactly one **Delivery** to ensure timely delivery of the food (10-15 minutes).
4. Users can provide **Feedback**, which can be based on their experience with specific orders.
5. Payments are linked to each order to confirm transaction completion.

This ER diagram lays the groundwork for a logistics management system ensuring timely deliveries that meet user needs for convenience.
