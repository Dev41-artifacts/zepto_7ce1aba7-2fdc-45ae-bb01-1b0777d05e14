# Technical Design Document for Food Ordering Feature in Zepto

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the technical design for implementing the food ordering feature in Zepto, focusing on backend architecture, technology stack, and integration with delivery logistics to ensure a 10 to 15-minute delivery time.

## 2. System Design

### 2.1. Overview

The food ordering feature will enable users to browse, select, and order food items through the Zepto app, which pairs with an efficient delivery logistics system to guarantee rapid delivery.

### 2.2. Component Breakdown

#### 2.2.1. User Interface (UI)
- **Frontend Framework**: React.js (for dynamic and responsive UI)
- **Mobile Compatibility**: React Native for the mobile app experience

#### 2.2.2. Backend Services
- **APIs**: RESTful APIs using Node.js/Express
- **Database**: MongoDB (NoSQL) for flexibility in managing food and order data
- **Caching**: Redis for session management and caching frequently accessed data

#### 2.2.3. Delivery Management
- **Logistics API**: Integration with a third-party logistics provider (e.g., Dunzo, Swiggy Genie) or custom-built service to manage deliveries.
- **Geolocation Services**: Google Maps API for order tracking and optimal routing

### 2.3. Data Flow

1. User places an order through the UI.
2. The order request is sent to the backend service via RESTful API.
3. The backend processes the order, interacts with the database, and allocates delivery resources.
4. The logistics API manages the picking and delivery of the food item.
5. The delivery status is updated in the userâ€™s app in real-time.

## 3. Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: 
  - React.js
  - React Native
- **Backend**: 
  - Node.js
  - Express.js
- **Database**: 
  - MongoDB
- **Caching**: 
  - Redis
- **Logistics Provider**: 
  - Dunzo API / Swiggy API (or custom logistics service)
- **Geolocation**: 
  - Google Maps API
- **Deployment**: 
  - Docker for containerization
  - AWS (Elastic Beanstalk for app hosting, S3 for static assets)

## 4. Implementation Details

### 4.1. API Design

#### 4.1.1. Endpoints

- **GET /api/food-items**: Retrieve available food items
- **POST /api/orders**: Create a new order
- **GET /api/orders/{orderId}**: Fetch order details
- **PUT /api/orders/{orderId}/status**: Update order status

#### 4.2. Database Schema

- **Food Items Collection**
  - `id`: ObjectId
  - `name`: String
  - `price`: Number
  - `category`: String
  - `availability`: Boolean

- **Orders Collection**
  - `id`: ObjectId
  - `userId`: ObjectId
  - `foodItems`: Array of ObjectId
  - `status`: String (Pending, Delivered, etc.)
  - `timestamp`: Date

### 4.3. Security Considerations

- **Authentication**: JWT tokens for session management
- **Data Validation**: Implement validation for incoming requests using middleware
- **Rate Limiting**: To prevent abuse, utilize a rate-limiting package for API endpoints

## 5. Technical Constraints

- **Performance**: The system must handle at least 1000 concurrent users.
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: Use microservices architecture to ensure scalability with demand.
- **Delivery SLA**: Ensure integration with logistics allows less than 15-minute delivery time.

## 6. Testing Approach

### 6.1. Unit Testing
- Each API endpoint will be covered with unit tests using Jest or Mocha.

### 6.2. Integration Testing
- Test interactions between API, database, and third-party logistics providers through end-to-end scenarios.

### 6.3. Performance Testing
- Use tools like JMeter to stress-test the application under peak loads.

### 6.4. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
- Engage real users for testing the feature before a general release.

## 7. Deployment Considerations

- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Implement CI/CD using Jenkins or GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.
- **Monitoring**: Integrate monitoring (using New Relic or Prometheus) to track application health.
- **Rollback Strategy**: Create a rollback plan for failed deployments to ensure system reliability.

## 8. Conclusion

The food ordering feature in Zepto aims to provide a seamless experience with a robust backend system, ensuring a reliable and fast delivery mechanism. The implementation plan will focus on scalability, performance, and user satisfaction.
