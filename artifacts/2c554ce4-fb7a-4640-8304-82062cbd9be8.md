# Technical Design Document for Zepto Food Ordering Feature

## 1. Overview
This document provides a comprehensive design for implementing the food ordering system within Zepto. The main objectives are to offer a seamless user experience for food ordering and ensure efficient order processing.

## 2. Architecture
The system will be built on a client-server model leveraging RESTful APIs for communication between the frontend and backend services. The architecture will employ microservices to handle various aspects of order processing such as order placement, payment processing, and order tracking.

## 3. Technologies  
### 3.1 Frontend  
- **React Native:** For building a cross-platform mobile application that offers a responsive and user-friendly interface.  

### 3.2 Backend  
- **Node.js with Express:** To build a robust and scalable server-side application that handles API requests and business logic.  

### 3.3 Database  
- **PostgreSQL:** Utilized for efficient relational data storage, including user accounts, menu items, and order details.  

### 3.4 Third-party APIs  
- **Stripe:** For secure payment processing, supporting various payment methods.
- **Google Maps:** For delivery tracking and location services to enhance the customer experience.

## 4. Security Considerations  
### 4.1 User Data Encryption  
- Use AES encryption for sensitive data at rest and TLS for data in transit to ensure user information is protected from unauthorized access.  

### 4.2 Secure Payment Processing  
- Implement PCI-DSS compliance standards to handle payment information securely with Stripe.

### 4.3 API Authentication  
- Use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authenticating API requests, ensuring that only authorized users can access certain endpoints.

## 5. Performance  
### 5.1 Load Balancing  
- Deploy load balancers to distribute traffic among multiple instances of the backend services, ensuring high availability and reliability.

### 5.2 Caching Strategies  
- Implement caching using Redis or Memcached to improve response times for frequently accessed data such as menus and promotional offers.

## 6. Testing Approaches  
### 6.1 Unit Testing  
- Utilize testing frameworks such as Jest to write unit tests for both frontend and backend components.

### 6.2 Integration Testing  
- Conduct integration testing to verify that different services communicate effectively and as expected.

### 6.3 User Acceptance Testing  
- Perform UAT with a selected group of end-users to collect feedback and make necessary adjustments before full deployment.

## 7. Deployment Considerations  
### 7.1 Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)  
- Implement CI/CD pipelines using tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment processes.

### 7.2 Monitoring and Logging  
- Set up monitoring tools like Prometheus and logging services to capture application metrics and error logs, enabling proactive maintenance.

## 8. Conclusion  
This technical design document outlines a clear plan to implement the food ordering feature within Zepto, focusing on a modular, secure, and efficient architecture.
