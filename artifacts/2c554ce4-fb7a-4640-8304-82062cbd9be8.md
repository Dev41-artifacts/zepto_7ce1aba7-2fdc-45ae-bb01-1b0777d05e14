## 1. Introduction
Zepto is a platform designed to deliver groceries within 10 to 15 minutes, leveraging advanced technologies to ensure a seamless user experience. This document outlines the technical design, including the technologies used, system design, scalability, reliability, security considerations, testing approaches, and deployment strategies.

## 2. Technologies Used
### Front-End Technologies
- **React**: Used for building user interfaces, allowing for the creation of a responsive and dynamic single-page application.
- **Redux**: For state management, ensuring that the application remains performant and scalable.
- **CSS Modules**: For styling components securely and modularly.
- **WebSocket**: For real-time updates on order status, stock availability, and promotional notifications.

### Back-End Technologies
- **Node.js**: Asynchronous event-driven framework for building scalable network applications.
- **Express.js**: To create RESTful APIs for efficient data handling between front-end and back-end.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database to handle unstructured data with high performance and flexibility.
- **Redis**: For caching frequently accessed data and improving response times.
- **Docker**: For containerization, making the deployment and scaling of applications easier.
- **Kubernetes**: For orchestration, allowing for automated deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

## 3. System Design
### Architecture Overview
The architecture of Zepto consists of three main layers:
1. **Presentation Layer (Front-End)**: The user interface built with React and Redux.
2. **Business Logic Layer (Back-End)**: RESTful API served by Node.js and Express.
3. **Data Layer**: MongoDB for data storage and Redis for caching.

## 4. Scalability
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Both front-end and back-end systems can be horizontally scaled to manage increased load by adding more instances.
- **Load Balancing**: Implement load balancers to distribute incoming requests across multiple servers, ensuring consistent performance.
- **Decoupled Services**: Utilizing microservices architecture will allow independent scaling of different application components (e.g., inventory service, order service).

## 5. Reliability
- **Failover Mechanisms**: Implement redundant services and databases to ensure continuous operation in case of failures.
- **Data Backup**: Regular backups of databases to prevent data loss.
- **Monitoring Tools**: Employ tools like Prometheus and Grafana for real-time monitoring of application health and performance metrics.

## 6. Security Considerations
- **Data Encryption**: Use SSL for all data in transit and encrypt sensitive data at rest.
- **User Authentication**: Implement OAuth or JWT for secure user authentication.
- **Input Validation**: Protect against SQL Injection and XSS attacks by validating and sanitizing incoming data.

## 7. Testing Approaches
- **Unit Testing**: To ensure individual components' correctness using frameworks like Jest.
- **Integration Testing**: Testing interactions between components and services. 
- **End-to-End Testing**: Simulating user journeys using tools like Cypress or Selenium.

## 8. Deployment Considerations
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Set up continuous integration and deployment pipelines to automate testing and deployment processes using tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions.
- **Staging Environment**: Create a staging environment that mimics production for testing before rolling out changes.
- **Health Checks**: Implement health checks for services to automatically restart or notify when services are down.
