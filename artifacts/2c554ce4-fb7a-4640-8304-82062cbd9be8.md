# Technical Design Document for the Zepto Platform

## Overview

This document outlines the technical design for implementing the food ordering feature on the Zepto platform. The goal is to enable efficient food ordering with a focus on delivering orders within 10 to 15 minutes. This document covers the system architecture, technology stack, database schema, and system interactions necessary for achieving this functionality.

## 1. System Architecture

### 1.1 High-Level Architecture

The system architecture is comprised of several layers:

- **Client Layer**: Mobile applications (iOS and Android) used by customers to place orders.
- **API Gateway**: Acts as a single entry point for all requests to the backend services. It handles authentication, routing, and rate limiting.
- **Microservices Layer**: Composed of multiple services such as:

  - **Order Service**: Manages order creation, updates, and status tracking.
  - **Inventory Service**: Tracks food item availability in real-time.
  - **Delivery Service**: Manages delivery personnel and logistics to ensure timely delivery.
  - **User Service**: Manages user profiles and authentication.

- **Data Layer**: Responsible for data storage and retrieval.

### 1.2 Components Interaction

1. **Client to API Gateway**: Clients send requests to the API Gateway for order placement and management.
2. **API Gateway to Microservices**: The gateway routes requests to appropriate microservices.
3. **Microservices Communication**: Services communicate via RESTful APIs or message brokers for asynchronous tasks.
4. **Data Storage**: Each microservice interfaces with a dedicated database for data persistence.

## 2. Technology Stack

### 2.1 Frontend Technologies

- **Mobile Applications**: 
  - iOS: Swift
  - Android: Kotlin

### 2.2 Backend Technologies

- **API Gateway**: Node.js with Express
- **Microservices**: 
  - Order and User Services: Spring Boot
  - Inventory Service: Django
  - Delivery Service: Go
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational data, Redis for caching

### 2.3 Infrastructure

- **Hosting**: AWS (EC2, RDS)
- **Containerization**: Docker for microservices
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes for managing container deployment  

### 2.4 Notifications

- **Real-time Notifications**: WebSockets or Firebase Cloud Messaging for order updates.

## 3. Database Schema

### 3.1 Entity-Relationship Diagram

- **User**
  - UserID (PK)
  - Name
  - Email
  - Address
  - Phone  
  
- **Order**
  - OrderID (PK)
  - UserID (FK)
  - OrderStatus
  - OrderTime
  - TotalAmount

- **FoodItem**
  - FoodID (PK)
  - Name
  - Price
  - AvailabilityStatus  
  
- **Inventory**
  - InventoryID (PK)
  - FoodID (FK)
  - AvailableQuantity

## 4. System Interactions

### 4.1 Order Placement

1. **User Requests Order**: The user places an order via the mobile app.
2. **API Gateway Routes Request**: The API Gateway routes the request to the Order Service.
3. **Order Creation**: The Order Service creates an order entry in the database.
4. **Inventory Check**: The Inventory Service checks availability.
5. **Order Confirmation**: The system confirms the order and notifies the user.

### 4.2 Delivery Management

1. **Order Assignment**: The Delivery Service assigns a delivery personnel to the order.
2. **Real-Time Tracking**: The user can track the delivery in real time through the app.

## 5. Implementation Details

### 5.1 Code Structure

Each microservice will follow the MVC architecture with the following structure:

```
/service-name
|-- /controllers
|-- /models
|-- /routes
|-- /services
|-- app.js
|-- Dockerfile
```

### 5.2 Security

- **Authentication**: JWT for secure API access.
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control for different user types.

---

## 6. Technical Constraints

- **Latency**: Must ensure that the end-to-end latency for order completion not exceeds 15 minutes.
- **Scalability**: The system must scale to handle peak loads, particularly in urban environments.
- **Data Consistency**: Strong consistency is required for inventory status to avoid overselling.

---

## 7. Testing Approaches

### 7.1 Unit Testing

- Each microservice will include unit tests for individual components.

### 7.2 Integration Testing

- End-to-end tests will be performed to validate system interactions.

### 7.3 Performance Testing

- Load testing to ensure the system can handle a high volume of simultaneous orders.

### 7.4 User Acceptance Testing

- Beta testing with a selected group of users for feedback.

---

## 8. Deployment Considerations

- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Utilize CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Use Terraform for provisioning infrastructure in AWS.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Implement logging with ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) and monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana.
