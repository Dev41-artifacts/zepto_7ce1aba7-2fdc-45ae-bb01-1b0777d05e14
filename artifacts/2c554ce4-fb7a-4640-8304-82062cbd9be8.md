## Overview
Zepto is a rapid-delivery logistics platform that enables users to order goods via a mobile app and have them delivered within a short timeframe. The following document outlines the technical design of the platform, focusing on the delivery system.

## System Architecture
The Zepto delivery platform follows a microservices architecture that allows for scalability and maintainability. The key components of the architecture include:

- **Client Application**: Frontend mobile app for users to place orders.
- **API Gateway**: Entry point for clients to access various services.
- **Order Service**: Manages order placements and statuses.
- **Inventory Service**: Tracks product availability and updates.
- **Delivery Service**: Responsible for scheduling and managing deliveries.
- **Payment Service**: Handles payment processing for orders.
- **Notification Service**: Sends alerts to customers about order status.
- **Database**: Persist data using a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL).

## Data Models
The following data models are crucial for the delivery system:

1. **User**: Stores user information.
   - `user_id`: UUID
   - `name`: String
   - `email`: String
   - `address`: String

2. **Order**: Records order details.
   - `order_id`: UUID
   - `user_id`: UUID (FK)
   - `product_id`: UUID (FK)
   - `quantity`: Integer
   - `status`: Enum (Pending, In-Progress, Completed)
   - `created_at`: Timestamp

3. **Product**: Represents products available for delivery.
   - `product_id`: UUID
   - `name`: String
   - `price`: Decimal
   - `stock`: Integer

4. **Delivery**: Contains information about delivery.
   - `delivery_id`: UUID
   - `order_id`: UUID (FK)
   - `delivery_status`: Enum (Scheduled, Out for Delivery, Delivered)
   - `expected_delivery_time`: Timestamp

## Integration Points
- **Payment Gateway**: Integrate with third-party payment processors (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).
- **Map Services**: Use Google Maps API for route optimization and address validation.
- **SMS Service**: Integrate with Twilio or similar services for sending notifications.
- **Analytics**: Track user interactions and delivery performance using Google Analytics or custom solutions.

## Implementation Details
- **Tech Stack**: Node.js for the server, PostgreSQL for the database, React Native for the mobile app.
- **Microservices Communication**: Use RESTful APIs for service communication with JSON payloads.
- **Authentication**: Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication.

## Technical Constraints
- **Scalability**: The system must handle spikes in user traffic during peak hours (e.g., evenings, weekends).
- **Performance**: API calls should have an average response time of under 200 ms.
- **Data Security**: Ensure PCI DSS compliance for payment processing and GDPR compliance for user data handling.

## Testing Approaches
- **Unit Testing**: Each service will have unit tests for core functionalities.
- **Integration Testing**: Validate interactions between services using tools like Postman or JMeter.
- **Load Testing**: Simulate user load to check handling under stress conditions.
- **End-to-End Testing**: Verify the entire workflow from order placement to delivery completion.

## Deployment Considerations
- **Environment**: Use Docker containers to create consistent deployment environments.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Establish a continuous integration and deployment process using GitHub Actions or Jenkins.
- **Monitoring**: Implement application performance monitoring (APM) tools like New Relic or Datadog to monitor system health and performance.
