# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Food Ordering Feature Data Flow in Zepto

## Overview

The food ordering feature within Zepto allows users to browse, select, and order food items for delivery. The architecture includes data generation from user interactions, order processing, preparation time management, and delivery logistics. 

## Data Flow Components

### 1. Data Sources

- **User Input**  
  - **Selections:** User selects items from the menu.  
  - **Preferences:** User inputs for customization (e.g., toppings, dietary restrictions).  
  - **Location Data:** User-provided or automatically fetched location for delivery.

- **Menu Database**  
  - Item availability and details (descriptions, prices).
  
- **User Profile Database**  
  - User history, preferences, and payment information.

### 2. Data Transformations

- **User Selections**  
  - From the front-end, user selections trigger APIs that validate inputs.  
  - Selection data is transformed into a structured format (JSON) for processing.

- **Order Creation**  
  - The system accepts user input through an API endpoint and constructs an order object.  
  - Order object includes:  
    - User ID  
    - List of selected items  
    - Customizations  
    - Delivery details

- **Preparation and Time Estimation**  
  - After order creation, the system triggers a preparation time calculation based on:  
    - Item complexity  
    - Current kitchen workload

### 3. Data Storage

- **Order Database**  
  - Stores all details related to placed orders, including statuses (pending, in preparation, delivered).
  
- **Inventory Database**  
  - Tracks availability of ingredients and menu items. Updates driven by order placements.

- **User Activity Logs**  
  - Records user interactions including searches, order history, and feedback.

### 4. Data Consumption Patterns

- **Order Lifecycle**  
  1. **Order Placement:** User confirms selections, triggering backend order processing.  
  2. **Guided Order Management:** Users can track order status in real-time through the app.
  
- **Preparation and Delivery Notifications**  
  - Users receive notifications via push messages about:  
    - Estimated preparation time.  
    - Delivery status updates.

- **Feedback Mechanism**  
  - After delivery, users are prompted to provide feedback on their experience, which is recorded for improving services.
