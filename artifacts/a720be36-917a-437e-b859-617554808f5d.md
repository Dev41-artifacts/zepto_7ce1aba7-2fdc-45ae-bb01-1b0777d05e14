# Data Flow Diagram for Zepto

## Overview
This document describes the data flow within the Zepto system, detailing the interactions between users, the application, and delivery personnel. It outlines data sources, transformations, storage mechanisms, and consumption patterns.

## Key Components

### 1. Users
- **Actions**: Place orders, track orders, request support.
- **Data Generated**: User details, order details, and interaction logs.

### 2. Application (Logistics Management)
- **Functions**: Manage orders, allocate deliveries, handle user requests.
- **Data Transformed**: User input (orders) into order management and logistics data.

### 3. Delivery Personnel
- **Actions**: Receive delivery assignments, update delivery status.
- **Data Produced**: Delivery status updates and completion confirmations.

## Data Flow Description

### User Interaction
- **Input**: Users place orders through a mobile or web application.
- **Output**: Order confirmation and estimated delivery time.
- **Data Flow**:
  - User inputs data (e.g., product selection, address).
  - System creates an order record and stores it in the database.

### Order Processing
- **Input**: Order details from the user.
- **Transformation**: The application validates the order and checks inventory.
- **Storage**: Order and user data are stored in a relational database.
- **Output**: Allocation of logistics resources (e.g., assigning delivery personnel).

### Logistics Management
- **Input**: Confirmed orders from the order management system.
- **Processing**:
  - The system schedules delivery time slots.
  - Updates the inventory.
- **Output**: Dispatch details sent to delivery personnel.

### Delivery Personnel
- **Input**: Delivery assignments from the application.
- **Actions**: Pick up the order and deliver it to the user.
- **Output**:
  - Update status (pickup confirmed, in transit, delivered) back to the application.

### Order Tracking
- **User Action**: Users can track their orders in real-time.
- **Application**: Fetches live status updates from the logistics management system.
- **Output**: Users receive notifications on order status changes (delivered, delayed).

## Data Storage
- **Databases**: 
  - User Database: Stores user profiles and interaction history.
  - Order Database: Manages order details and status.
  - Inventory Database: Tracks product availability and stock levels.

## Consumption Patterns
1. **User Consumption**: Users interact with the mobile/web app for placing orders and tracking them.
2. **Application Consumption**: The application processes incoming user data and logistics management.
3. **Delivery Personnel Consumption**: Delivery personnel use a mobile app to receive orders and update their status.

## Conclusion
The data flow for Zepto effectively captures user interactions, order processing, and logistics management, ensuring smooth operations from order placement to delivery. This document provides a comprehensive overview for stakeholders to understand the system's architecture and functionality.
