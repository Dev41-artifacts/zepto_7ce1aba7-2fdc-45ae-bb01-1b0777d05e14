# Zepto System Architecture

The architecture for Zepto consists of several components, including the front-end interface, back-end services, and integration with payment gateways. The key components and their interactions are described below.

## Components

1. **Front-End Interface**  
   - **Web and Mobile Applications**: User interface for customers to browse products, place orders, and track shipments.  
   - **Technologies Used**: React (Web), React Native (Mobile), HTML/CSS, JavaScript.

2. **Back-End Services**  
   - **Order Processing Service**  
     - Responsible for managing the order lifecycle including creation, updating, and retrieval of orders.  
     - **Technologies Used**: Node.js, Express, MongoDB for order data storage.  
   - **Logistics Management Service**  
     - Handles the logistics, including inventory management and shipment tracking.  
     - **Technologies Used**: Java (Spring Boot) for service logic, Redis for caching.  
   - **User Management Service**  
     - Manages user accounts and authentication.  
     - **Technologies Used**: Python (Django), PostgreSQL for user data.

3. **Integration with Payment Gateways**  
   - Interfaces to external payment processors for handling transactions.  
   - **Technologies Used**: Payment Gateway APIs (Stripe, PayPal).

## Data Flow

1. **User Interaction**: The user interacts with the front-end application to place an order.  
2. **Order Creation**:  
   - The front-end sends the order details to the Order Processing Service via API calls.  
   - The Order Processing Service validates the order and stores it in the database.
3. **Logistics Handling**:  
   - Upon order creation, the Order Processing Service triggers the Logistics Management Service to allocate inventory and prepare for shipment.  
   - The Logistics Service keeps track of order statuses & communicates with third-party logistics (3PL) services as needed.
4. **Payment Processing**:  
   - After the order is confirmed, the Order Processing Service requests payment processing through the integrated payment gateway.  
   - The gateway processes the transaction and returns a success or failure response.
5. **Notifications**:  
   - Once the payment is confirmed and the order is shipped, notifications are sent to the user through the front-end application.

## Technical Stack Considerations

- **Front-End**: React for a seamless user experience across web and mobile platforms.  
- **Back-End**: Utilize microservices architecture to allow independent scaling and maintenance of each service.  
- **Database Management**: Use MongoDB for flexibility in order management and PostgreSQL for structured user data.  
- **API Design**: RESTful API for communication between front-end and back-end services.  
- **Security**: Implement OAuth 2.0 for user authentication and HTTPS for secure data transmission.  
- **Scalability**: Leverage cloud services (AWS, Azure) for hosting and scale services independently based on traffic.

## Conclusion

This architecture provides a robust system for Zepto to manage its order processing, logistics, and payment integrations efficiently. The modular approach allows for scalability and maintainability while ensuring a seamless user experience.
