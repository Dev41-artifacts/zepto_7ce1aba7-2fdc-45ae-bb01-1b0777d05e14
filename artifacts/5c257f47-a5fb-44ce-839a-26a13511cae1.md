# Zepto Grocery Delivery Platform - System Architecture Document

## Overview

The Zepto grocery delivery platform is designed to facilitate the swift ordering and delivery of groceries. The architecture is structured to ensure seamless operations while guaranteeing delivery within a 10-minute timeframe.

## System Components

1. **Front-End User Interface**  
   - **Description**: A responsive web/mobile application that allows users to browse grocery items, place orders, and track deliveries.  
   - **Technologies**:   
     - React (Web)  
     - React Native (Mobile)  
     - Redux (State Management)  
     - Axios (API calls)  
   - **Interactions**: Users can register, log in, view products, add items to cart, and track order status.

2. **Back-End Order Processing System**  
   - **Description**: A robust server-side component that handles order placement, updates, and maintains the product database.  
   - **Technologies**:   
     - Node.js with Express (API Development)  
     - MongoDB (Database Management)  
     - Redis (Cache Management)  
   - **Interactions**: Processes incoming orders, updates inventory, and notifies the delivery logistics module.

3. **Delivery Logistics**  
   - **Description**: This module manages the routing and scheduling of deliveries to ensure quick dispatch.  
   - **Technologies**:   
     - Python (Logic Processing)  
     - Google Maps API (Routing)  
     - RabbitMQ (Message Queuing for real-time updates)  
   - **Interactions**: Receives orders from the backend, calculates optimal routes, assigns deliveries to drivers.

4. **Payment Processing**  
   - **Description**: Handles secure transactions for user payments.  
   - **Technologies**:   
     - Stripe API (Payment Gateway)  
     - SSL Certificates (Security)  
   - **Interactions**: Communicates with the backend to finalize orders post-payment confirmation.

## Data Flow

1. **Order Placement**  
   - User initiates an order via the UI.  
   - The front end sends the order details to the back end through API calls.

2. **Order Processing**  
   - The back end verifies the order and checks product availability.  
   - If available, the order is stored in the database, and an update is sent to the delivery logistics system.

3. **Delivery Scheduling**  
   - The delivery logistics module receives the order and uses routing algorithms to assign a driver for swift delivery.

4. **Payment Processing**  
   - User completes payment through the interface, which communicates with the payment gateway to process the transaction.  
   - Upon success, confirmation is sent back to the back end, which finalizes the order.

5. **Order Tracking**  
   - Users can track their orders in real-time through the UI, with updates pushed from the backend to the frontend.

```

## Technical Stack Considerations

- Ensure scalability to handle a high number of simultaneous users.
- Utilize caching (Redis) to reduce latency in data retrieval.
- Implement a robust message queue (RabbitMQ) to manage real-time delivery updates efficiently.
- Optimize the delivery logic with sophisticated routing algorithms to ensure adherence to the 10-minute delivery promise.
- Employ high-security standards for payment processing, including encryption and compliance with PCI DSS.
