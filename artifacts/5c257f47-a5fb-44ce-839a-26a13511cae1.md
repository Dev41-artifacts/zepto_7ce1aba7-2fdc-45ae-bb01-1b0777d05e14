# Zepto Architecture Diagram

## Overview
Zepto is designed to operate a unified platform that integrates logistics management and food delivery services. The architecture comprises various system components interacting through APIs, facilitating efficient data flow and operations.

## Components

### 1. **User Interface (UI)**
- **Mobile App/Web App**: Frontend interface for customers to place orders, track deliveries, and manage accounts.
  
### 2. **API Gateway**
- Acts as a single entry point for all client requests.
- Validates requests, routes them to respective services, and aggregates responses.

### 3. **Order Management Service**
- Manages the lifecycle of customer orders.
- Coordinates between logistics and delivery services.
- Stores order details in the database.

### 4. **Logistics Service**
- Handles the management of delivery agents, routes, and logistics operations.
- Integrates with mapping services for optimal routing.
  
### 5. **Food Delivery Service**
- Responsible for processing food orders from various restaurants.
- Maintains partnerships with restaurants and manages menu listings.

### 6. **Database**
- **Relational Database**: Stores structured data related to users, orders, and food items.
- **NoSQL Database**: Manages unstructured data and logs for analytics.

### 7. **Message Queue**
- Facilitates asynchronous communication between services.
- Ensures reliability and scalability of the system.

### 8. **Notification Service**
- Sends alerts to users regarding their orders using SMS, email, or in-app notifications.

### 9. **Analytics Service**
- Analyzes order data for business insights.
- Provides reporting features on user engagement, order history, and delivery performance.

## Data Flow
1. **User Interaction**: The user places an order through the UI.
2. **API Gateway**: The request reaches the API gateway for validation and routing.
3. **Order Management**: The order is processed and stored in the database.
4. **Logistics Activation**: The logistics service is notified to assign delivery agents.
5. **Order Fulfillment**: The food delivery service prepares and assigns logistics for order delivery.
6. **Notifications**: The notification service informs the user of their order status.
7. **Analytics**: Data from the order is sent to the analytics service for insights.

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React Native or Flutter for the mobile app; Angular or React for web.
- **Backend**: Node.js or Spring Boot for microservices.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Relational) and MongoDB (NoSQL).
- **Messaging**: RabbitMQ or Kafka for the message queue.
- **Infrastructure**: Docker for containerization, Kubernetes for orchestration, and AWS/Azure for cloud hosting.
